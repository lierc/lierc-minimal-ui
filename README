A basic UI for lierc
====================

This is a frontend that uses the lierc-api.

This directory is mounted by the `lierc-h2o` container, and used
as the root directory served by the `h2o` HTTP server.

To build the assets run `make`. To monitor changes to assets and
rebuild automatically, run `make watch`. This make target requires
some perl modules to work.

Install dependencies with:

```
sudo apt-get install node-uglify cpanminus
sudo cpanm -nq AnyEvent::Filesys::Notify
```

Or, if you're on another platform, make sure you have cpanminus installed (along with the package above) as well as node and npm. Then, run:

```
npm install uglify-js@2.4.11 -g
npm install bro -g
```
